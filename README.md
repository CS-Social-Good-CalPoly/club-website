## Pull Requests and Github Issues
We use pull requests (PRs) and Github Issues to make sure they are are inline with our scrum board and to make sure features are up to specification before deploying them, and as a learning opportunity for you to look at other's code to enforce good design!
#### Creating a PR
- Push the changes from your local feature branch to your remote feature branch
- On Github, select your feature branch from the "branches" dropdown and then click the Pull request button
- Leave a comment describing what changes you made. If you made a UI change, it is helpful to include a screenshot of that change
 **PRs are required to have a review of approval from Srirag before being merged into master.**
- Click the Create pull request button
- Fix any merge conflicts and make requested changes from reviewers as necessary
- Merge your branch into master once two people have approved your changes
