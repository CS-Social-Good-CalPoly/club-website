This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to get started
Clone the repository locally using the command:

        $ git clone "https://github.com/CSSGCalPoly/club-website.git"

Create your own branch to do your development:

        $ git branch <name of your new branch>   *brackets not required

To move to the new branch, you can run:

        $ git checkout <name of your new branch>  *brackets not required

After you're done with commiting locally run this command to push to the repository as a branch:

        $ git push -u origin <name of your local new branch>
        

 
## Helpful tips 
- To run the website for testing purposes:

        $ npm install 
        $ npm start

- To go through the changes you're making before commiting, run :

        $ git add -p

- To git commit:

        $ git commit -m "Your commit message"
        
- If you want to check the list of branches, simply run:

        $ git branch
